Okay, I will proceed with implementing the requested changes.

First, I will address Comment 1 and Comment 2 by modifying the `project.pbxproj` file. I will read the file to understand its current structure.
I have analyzed the `project.pbxproj` and formulated the changes needed for comments 1 and 2. I will perform these modifications using `replace`.

First, I will add `HistoricalPolicyValidationTests.swift` to the `PBXSourcesBuildPhase` of the `decodingOppressionTests` target.
Next, I will add `validation_clauses.jsonl` to the `PBXResourcesBuildPhase` of the `decodingOppressionTests` target. This involves adding a new `PBXBuildFile` entry for the resource and then referencing it in the build phase's files array.
I have addressed Comments 1 and 2 by modifying the `project.pbxproj` file. Now I will tackle Comment 3, which requires changes to `decodingOppressionTests/HistoricalPolicyValidationTests.swift`. I'll start by reading the file.
I will now remove the `withKnownIssue` block from `HistoricalPolicyValidationTests.swift`, leaving the inner code to execute directly. This addresses the compilation issue related to `async/await` calls within `withKnownIssue`.
I have completed the tasks related to `project.pbxproj` and `HistoricalPolicyValidationTests.swift` as requested in Comments 1, 2, and 3.

Regarding **Comment 4** ("Training/validation datasets far smaller than planned stratified set, leaving T9 goals unmet"), this task requires generating specific JSONL data to meet stratified counts. As I do not have the capability to generate new data or invent content for these files while maintaining schema consistency and unique IDs, I am unable to complete this part of the request.
