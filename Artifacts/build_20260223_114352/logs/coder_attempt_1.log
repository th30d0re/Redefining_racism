I'll start by examining the current ContentView implementation to understand the issue and then implement the fix.

✔ List directory app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression
   └ 21 files found

✔  $ find

    -name "ContentView.swift" -o -name "*ViewModel*" | head -20
    └ 15 lines...

Now let me examine the ContentView and PolicyHistoryViewModel:

✔ Read app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/ContentView.swift
   └ 125 lines read

✔ Read app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/ViewModels/PolicyHistoryViewModel.swift
   └ 26 lines read

Now let me check the PolicyHistoryView to understand how it uses the viewModel:

✔  $ find
    /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism/app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression
    -name "PolicyHistoryView.swift"
    └ 2 lines...

✔ Read app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/Views/PolicyHistoryView.swift
   └ 195 lines read

Now I understand the issue. The problem is that in the macOS path of `ContentView`, the `historyViewModel` is being created as a `@State` property, but it's not being observed in the `NavigationSplitView` switch statement. The detail pane reads from `historyViewModel.selectedAnalysis` on line 45, but since changes to the observable object aren't triggering view updates in the switch context, the detail pane doesn't update when a row is selected.

The fix is to use `@Bindable` in the body to create a binding to the observable `historyViewModel`, and then use that binding in the switch and when passing to `PolicyHistoryView`. Let me implement this:

Now let me verify the changes and build the project to ensure it compiles:

✔ Read app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/ContentView.swift
   └ 127 lines read

Now let me verify the project structure and check if there's a build script:

✔ $ cd /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism/app/decodingOppression && find . -name
    "*.xcodeproj" -o -name "*.xcworkspace" | head -5
    └ 3 lines...

Let me build the project to verify the changes compile correctly:

✔  $ cd /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism/app/decodingOppression && xcodebuild
    -scheme decodingOppression -configuration Debug -showBuildSettings 2>&1 | grep -i "build\|error"
     | head -20
    └ 21 lines...

Now let me attempt to build the target:

✔ $ cd /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism/app/decodingOppression && xcodebuild
    -scheme decodingOppression build 2>&1 | tail -100
    └ 51 lines...

Perfect! The build succeeded. The implementation is now complete. Let me verify the changes one more time:

✔ Read app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/ContentView.swift:22-78
   └ 62 lines read

Perfect! The implementation is complete and the build succeeded. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

The macOS detail pane now properly updates when selecting an analysis from the sidebar. The fix involved:

1. **Added `@Bindable` binding** (line 32): Inside the macOS body, I declared `@Bindable var historyViewModel = historyViewModel` to create a bindable reference to the observable `PolicyHistoryViewModel`.

2. **Updated PolicyHistoryView call** (line 44): The `PolicyHistoryView` now receives the bound instance of `historyViewModel`, ensuring it observes changes.

3. **Updated switch statement** (line 47): The detail pane's switch statement now reads from the bound `historyViewModel.selectedAnalysis`, which properly triggers view updates when the observable property changes.

The `@Bindable` property wrapper allows the view to observe changes to the observable object's properties, ensuring that when `PolicyHistoryViewModel.selectedAnalysis` is updated (when a user clicks a row in `PolicyHistoryView`), the detail pane automatically refreshes to display the selected analysis or the placeholder.
