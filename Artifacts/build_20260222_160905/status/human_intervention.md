# Human Intervention Required

## Summary
Build Agent failed after 5 repair attempts.

## Timestamp
2026-02-22T21:47:37Z

## Configuration
- Scheme: decodingOppression
- Configuration: Debug
- Target: default simulator

## Input
I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

## Observations

\`GenerableTypes.swift\` already defines all three \`@Generable\` structs (\`ClauseClassification\`, \`ArchitectureDetection\`, \`ProxyDetection\`) gated behind \`#if canImport(FoundationModels)\`. \`PipelineContracts.swift\` has \`TierClassification\` and \`AnalysisProgress\`. \`Tier1Engine\` and \`Tier2Engine\` are both \`actor\` types returning \`TierClassification?\`. No \`AI/\` folder, \`Tier3Engine\`, \`PolicyAnalysisSession\`, \`HistoricalBaselineTool\`, or \`HistoricalPolicies\` exist yet.

## Approach

Create a new \`AI/\` group inside the Xcode target with five focused files: \`Tier3Error\`, \`HistoricalPolicies\`, \`HistoricalBaselineTool\`, \`PolicyAnalysisSession\`, and \`Tier3Engine\`. Each file is gated behind \`#if canImport(FoundationModels)\` with a stub fallback, mirroring the pattern already used in \`GenerableTypes.swift\`. \`Tier3Engine\` mirrors the \`Tier2Engine\` public actor interface so \`TierResolver\` (T5) can consume both symmetrically.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create \`AI/Tier3Error.swift\`

Add a new file at \`file:app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/AI/Tier3Error.swift\`.

Define an \`enum Tier3Error: Error\` with cases:
- \`.unavailable\` — Foundation Models not available on this device/configuration
- \`.safetyGuardrail\` — prompt was rejected by the safety system (caught internally, never surfaced to callers)
- \`.contextWindowExceeded\` — \`exceededContextWindowSize\` persisted even after condensed-text retry
- \`.sessionFailed(Error)\` — wraps any other \`LanguageModelSession\` error for internal logging

### 2. Create \`AI/HistoricalPolicies.swift\`

Add \`file:app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/AI/HistoricalPolicies.swift\`.

Define a \`struct HistoricalPolicies\` with a \`static func score(for policyName: String) -> Double\` that returns the expected COI for each of the four ground-truth policies:

| Policy | Expected COI |
|---|---|
| Virginia Slave Codes (1705) | 0.93 |
| 13th Amendment (1865) | 0.35 |
| HOLC Redlining (1934) | 0.82 |
| War on Drugs (1971) | 0.78 |

Return \`0.0\` for unrecognised names. This struct is the single source of truth consumed by both \`HistoricalBaselineTool\` (T4) and the \`ValidationRunner\` (T8/T9).

---

### 3. Create \`AI/HistoricalBaselineTool.swift\`

Add \`file:app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/AI/HistoricalBaselineTool.swift\`.

Gate the entire file behind \`#if canImport(FoundationModels)\`.

Define \`struct HistoricalBaselineTool: Tool\`:
...

## Error History


## Recommendations
1. Review the error logs above
2. Check for missing dependencies or configuration issues
3. Manually fix the problematic code
4. Re-run the build agent after fixes
