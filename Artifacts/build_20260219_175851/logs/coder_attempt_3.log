thinking
**Investigating unexpected main actor isolation**

I'm confirming that ScoreResult itself isn't annotated with @MainActor but its Decodable conformance is treated as main actor-isolated, likely due to nesting in or association with a @MainActor context or global annotation in the file or module; next, I'll search project-wide for such @MainActor usage.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'rg -n "@MainActor|main actor" app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression' in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism exited 1 in 52ms:



thinking
**Identifying default main actor isolation causing conformance warning**

I found that the build applies default main actor isolation (`-default-isolation=MainActor`), making `ScoreResult`'s `Decodable` conformance main actor-isolated by default. This causes a conflict when decoding it in a nonisolated context, explaining the warning and suggesting `ScoreResult` needs explicit `nonisolated` annotation for Codable conformance.
thinking
**Clarifying Swift 6 default isolation opt-out strategy**

I'm confirming that with Swift 6's default MainActor isolation, opt-out requires marking the type or its members as `nonisolated` (or possibly `@preconcurrency`), but not `@MainActor`. Next, I'll search the repo for existing uses of `nonisolated` to see how best to apply it to `ScoreResult`.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'rg -n "nonisolated" app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression' in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism exited 1 in 52ms:



thinking
**Considering concurrency fixes for Codable conformance**

I'm weighing fixes for the main-actor isolation warning on Codable conformance, including adding `@preconcurrency`, using `nonisolated` annotations, or shifting JSON encoding/decoding to a `@MainActor`-isolated context to align concurrency expectations.
thinking
**Reasoning that ScoreResult must be marked nonisolated**

Analysis shows ScoreResult’s Codable conformance is main actor isolated due to default module isolation, conflicting with JSONDecoder’s nonisolated decoding; the fix is to mark ScoreResult explicitly as nonisolated to opt out of this isolation and prevent Swift 6 errors.

**Clarifying build failure cause**

The xcodebuild failure stems from environment permission issues unrelated to code errors, while the user's reported build failure likely involves Swift 6 concurrency warnings turned errors. I'll fix those by making the relevant code nonisolated and request the full build log to verify and retest.
thinking
**Summarizing build log findings and fixes**

I found build logs showing success but Swift 6 concurrency warnings on ScoreResult, now fixed by marking it nonisolated and Sendable. Full xcodebuild failed here due to environment permissions, so I can’t fully verify. I’ll ask the user for their build command and logs to confirm and retest.

**Summarizing build and environment issues**

I confirmed build logs show success except for Swift 6 main actor warnings on ScoreResult, which I addressed by marking it nonisolated and Sendable for Codable compatibility. The sandbox blocks full recompilation here due to CoreSimulator cache access, so I recommend rerunning locally with detailed logging and sharing the exact failing target or build command.
thinking
**Clarifying environment vs repo build issues**

I’ll explain the xcodebuild failure here stems from sandbox cache permission errors, not repo code, and suggest users share console output or xcresult path if build still fails. I’ll also note npm and latexmk builds succeed in this environment. Since warnings only appear on ScoreResult, I’ll confirm no other Codable models show similar issues before proposing fixes.

**Summarizing fix and next steps**

I found relevant Swift 6 warnings about ScoreResult's actor-isolated Codable conformance and fixed them by marking it nonisolated and Sendable in one file. Build succeeded except xcodebuild can't run in this environment; user should run it locally to confirm the fix. I also noticed many preexisting modified/untracked files and will ask whether to ignore or clean them.

**Preparing detailed user instructions**

I'm drafting a response noting the fixed file path, asking the user to run the build and share output if issues persist, and mentioning many existing untracked/modified files with a question on how to proceed. I'll provide clear, simple lists for next steps without nested bullets, per instructions.

I couldn’t find any actual build *errors* in the repo’s existing logs. The latest Xcode build logs under `Artifacts/` show **success**, but they do include Swift 6–future errors about `ScoreResult` being main‑actor isolated when used with `JSONDecoder`/`JSONEncoder`. Those warnings become errors in Swift 6, so I fixed that.

**Fix applied**
- Made `ScoreResult` explicitly nonisolated (and `Sendable`) so its `Codable` conformance is usable from nonisolated contexts.
- File: `app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/Models/ScoreResult.swift`

I attempted to re-run `xcodebuild`, but in this environment it fails due to sandboxed cache/CoreSimulator permission issues (not code errors). So I can’t fully verify here.

Also, I noticed a large number of pre‑existing modified/untracked files in the working tree (Xcode project files, LaTeX build artifacts, etc.). I didn’t touch those. How would you like me to handle that?

**Next steps**
1. Re-run your build locally and paste the console output if it still fails (especially the first error block).
2. Tell me which build command/target is failing (Xcode app, website `npm run build`, or LaTeX).
