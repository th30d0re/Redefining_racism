**Planning repo inspection**

I'll start by listing the repo contents and consider if building is necessary next, checking for any errors that might require a build step.

**Checking build errors**

I'm investigating build failures, suspecting LaTeX issues due to the absence of build logs and the presence of a file named Redefining_Racism.log.

/bin/zsh -lc 'ls -1 *.log 2>/dev/null || true' in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism succeeded in 52ms:

**Investigating build context**

I'm checking for build-related info in the README to clarify which build the user refers to, aiming to identify the correct build system and relevant scripts before asking for more specifics.

**Checking LaTeX build environment**

I'm verifying if the LaTeX build uses latexmk and confirming whether TeX is installed, since the log looks OK but the "Build failed" message lacks detail; I'll check for package.json to see if another build (like a website) might be interfering.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "rg --files -g 'package.json' -g 'pnpm-lock.yaml' -g 'yarn.lock' -g 'package-lock.json'" in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism succeeded in 51ms:

**Investigating app folder for build context**

I'm checking the `app` folder to determine if it relates to a Swift or iOS Xcode project, clarifying the build environment since the current build passes without errors but suspicions about build errors possibly coming from another system remain.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'ls app' in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism succeeded in 51ms:

**Planning investigation of iOS build failure**

Next I'll locate and inspect AGENTS.md for build instructions and request the user to specify which build command and environment are causing failures.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "rg --files -g 'AGENTS.md'" in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism exited 1 in 51ms:



thinking
**Confirming build success and requesting failure details**

I verified the LaTeX log and website build both succeeded without errors; to diagnose the failure, I'll ask for the exact build command or full CI log, clarifying which build system they use. I'll suggest running standard commands like `latexmk -pdf Redefining_Racism.tex` or the appropriate build tool, and request detailed error output if available.
thinking
**Clarifying build environment and requesting failure command**

I'll ask which build the user runs (LaTeX, website, or iOS), share that website and LaTeX builds succeeded on my side, and request the exact failing command and its output to help diagnose.
codex
I can’t reproduce a failure yet. I checked the LaTeX log and it shows a successful build, and `npm run build` in `website/` completes cleanly.

To fix this, I need the exact build that’s failing. Which target are you building and with what command?

Common ones in this repo:
1. LaTeX: `latexmk -pdf Redefining_Racism.tex`
2. Website: `npm run build` in `website/`
3. iOS app: Xcode build from `app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression.xcodeproj`

Please paste the exact command and the full output (even if it says “no detailed error log”), or tell me the CI job name so I can reproduce it locally.
