**Checking LaTeX build errors**

Planning to run latexmk on the main .tex file to capture detailed compile errors since the user reported build failure without logs.

**Checking for build errors in website**

I'll examine the website's build system and scripts via package.json and searches for build-related commands to determine if build errors occur there.

**Running build to check for errors**

I'll try running the build script next to catch any build errors that could indicate problems.

**Checking for app directory or Swift code**

**Identifying build error context**

The user’s build error is unclear, possibly from Xcode or LaTeX; since LaTeXmk didn’t run and there’s mention of a failed prior fix, next I'll check GitHub Actions workflows for build logs or errors.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "rg --files -g '.github/*' -g '.github/workflows/*'" in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism exited 1 in 52ms:


thinking
**Checking build error logs**

I'm opening the Redefining_Racism.log to investigate possible CI latex build errors referenced by "build errors" outside the repo.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'rg -n "! LaTeX Error|Undefined control sequence|Emergency stop|Fatal error" Redefining_Racism.log' in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism exited 1 in 52ms:



thinking
**Identifying potential build error sources**

No build errors appear in logs here, so the failure may stem from other tasks like `swiftDocs` or `Algo`. The build succeeds here, but environment differences (like missing packages or Xcode) could cause hidden failures elsewhere; next step is to request clarification and details on the user’s build environment and steps.
thinking
**Planning clarification request**

Builds for latex and website pass here, so I'll ask which build exactly is failing and request logs or commands to reproduce. I'll also check for a possible `swiftDocs` package to inspect next.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'ls swiftDocs' in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism succeeded in 51ms:

**Requesting build error details**

I'm unclear about the build errors mentioned and the environment used, so I'll ask for the exact command run and setup details to proceed meaningfully. I'll also check logs for explicit build error messages before further action.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'tail -n 40 Redefining_Racism.log' in /Users/emmanuel/Documents/Theory/Redefining_racism succeeded in 51ms:

thinking
**Considering build reproduction strategy**

I'm evaluating trying `xcodebuild` to reproduce app build errors despite possible environment limits, alongside running website and latex builds to find detailed error logs for fixing.
thinking
**Confirming clean builds and requesting details**

I ran `latexmk` and website build commands with only harmless warnings; no errors appeared. To proceed, I need the exact failing build command, environment details, and full error logs or verbose output to diagnose and fix the issue.
codex
I tried to reproduce the builds locally and couldn’t find any failures.

What I ran (both succeeded):
- `latexmk -pdf Redefining_Racism.tex` (no errors; only underfull hbox warnings around lines 956–957)
- `npm run build` in `website/` (Vite + TSC completed successfully)

If the failing build is something else (likely the iOS app in `app/decodingOppression`), I need the exact command and environment details to reproduce. Please share:
1. The exact build command you ran.
2. The full console output (even if it seems short).
3. Your environment versions: OS, Node, TeX Live, and/or Xcode.

If you don’t have logs, re-run with one of these and paste output:
- LaTeX:
  ```bash
  latexmk -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode -file-line-error Redefining_Racism.tex
  ```
- Website:
  ```bash
  npm run build -- --debug
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  tsc -b --verbose && vite build
  ```
- iOS app:
  ```bash
  xcodebuild -list -project app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression.xcodeproj
  ```

Once you provide the failing command and output, I’ll fix the specific errors.
