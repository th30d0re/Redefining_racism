# Human Intervention Required

## Summary
Build Agent failed after 5 repair attempts.

## Timestamp

## Configuration
- Scheme: decodingOppression
- Configuration: Debug
- Target: default simulator

## Input
I have the following verification comments after thorough review and exploration of the codebase. Implement the comments by following the instructions in the comments verbatim.

## Comment 1: Tier2/ModelDownloadManager never instantiated or started; Tier2 classification cannot run

In \`decodingOppressionApp\` (or a top-level environment container) create a shared \`ModelDownloadManager\` instance, call \`startDownload()\` based on UI intent, and inject it into a shared \`Tier2Engine\`. Plumb that engine through your pipeline/view-model so clause classification requests use it. Ensure the background URLSession identifier matches the manager’s \`sessionIdentifier\`.

## Comment 2: Embedding engine is unused and similarity API is missing from Tier2

Add a public async method on \`Tier2Engine\` that calls \`embeddingEngine.loadModel()\` and returns similarity or embeddings as required, and wire that into the pipeline or callers that need taxonomy matching. If not needed, remove the unused \`embeddingEngine\` property to avoid dead code.
