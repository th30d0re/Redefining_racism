## 📋 Abstract

This paper develops a formal mathematical framework for analyzing systems of oppression using **set theory**, **discrete mathematics**, and **historical analysis**. 

The framework identifies **four architectural components** common to all oppressive systems:

1. **Asymmetric autonomy restriction** between In-groups and Out-groups
2. **Selective empathy** that validates In-group suffering while dismissing Out-group harm
3. **Ideological justification** through spurious claims
4. **Resistance to structural critique**

Through detailed analysis of American racism—from slave patrols to mass incarceration—this work demonstrates that the **Out-group targeted by systemic oppression expands over time**, progressively encompassing groups once part of the In-group. 

This expansion reveals that oppressive systems serve not the nominal In-group but an **Elite class** ($E \subset I$) that uses division to prevent solidarity.

### 🔍 Key Insight

The transferability of this architecture across scales—from **macro-level racial systems** to **micro-level relational dynamics**—suggests that oppression operates through recognizable, formalizable patterns that can be identified and resisted across contexts.

## 🎓 Theoretical Framework

### Core Definitions

```
S = Oppressive System
I = In-group (privileged class)
O = Out-group (oppressed class)
E ⊂ I = Elite class (true beneficiaries)
A(x) = Autonomy function for group x
```

### Key Theorem

**Out-group Expansion**: For any oppressive system $S$ over time $t$, if $E \subset I$ represents the elite class that truly benefits, then:

$$|O(t)| \text{ is monotonically non-decreasing as } t \to \infty$$
