## Comment 1: Duplicate SwiftData model types declared twice causing redeclaration build failure

Remove the old placeholder definitions in \`app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/PolicyAnalysis.swift\` and \`app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/AnalyzedClause.swift\` (or exclude them from the target) so only the \`Models/\` versions remain. Ensure \`decodingOppressionApp\` continues to reference the \`Models/\` types in its \`Schema\` and that no other files reference the deleted placeholders.

## Comment 2: MLX Swift package referenced but not linked to app target

Open \`decodingOppression.xcodeproj\` in Xcode → Project → Package Dependencies and add \`https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm\` with rule “Up to Next Minor from 2.29.1”. In the \`decodingOppression\` target, add the MLX products (e.g., \`MLXLLM\`, \`MLXEmbedders\`, \`MLXLMCommon\`) to Frameworks & Libraries so they link. Commit the generated \`Package.resolved\`.
