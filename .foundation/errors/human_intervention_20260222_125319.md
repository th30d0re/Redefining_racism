# Human Intervention Required

## Summary
Build Agent failed after 5 repair attempts.

## Timestamp
2026-02-22T17:53:19Z

## Configuration
- Scheme: decodingOppression
- Configuration: Debug
- Target: default simulator

## Input
I have the following verification comments after thorough review and exploration of the codebase. Implement the comments by following the instructions in the comments verbatim.

---
## Comment 1: Tier1Engine.classify does not return the TierClassification result, causing a compile-time error.

In \`app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/NLP/Tier1Engine.swift\` update \`classify(clause:)\` to return the \`TierClassification\` produced by \`clauseAnalyzer.analyze\` (e.g., \`return await clauseAnalyzer.analyze(clause: clause)\`).

## Comment 2: Project build phases are empty, so sources and data (KeywordTaxonomies.json) are not included in the app bundle.

In \`app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj\` add all app Swift sources (including the NLP files) to the \`PBXSourcesBuildPhase\` of the \`decodingOppression\` target and add resources such as \`app/decodingOppression/decodingOppression/Data/KeywordTaxonomies.json\` to the \`PBXResourcesBuildPhase\`. Ensure target membership is set so the app builds and the taxonomy file is copied into the bundle.
