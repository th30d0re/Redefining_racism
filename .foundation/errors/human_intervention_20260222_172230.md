# Human Intervention Required

## Summary
Build Agent failed after 5 repair attempts.

## Timestamp
2026-02-22T22:22:30Z

## Configuration
- Scheme: decodingOppression
- Configuration: Debug
- Target: default simulator

## Input
I have the following verification comments after thorough review and exploration of the codebase. Implement the comments by following the instructions in the comments verbatim.

## Comment 1: Tier3 streaming path lacks availability/guardrail handling and can surface errors to callers

In \`AI/Tier3Engine.swift\` \`streamClassify\`, call \`checkAvailability()\` before creating the stream and return/finish early when it throws \`Tier3Error.unavailable\` (e.g., finish with that error or return an empty stream). Wrap the streaming loop in a \`do/catch\` that catches \`Tier3Error.safetyGuardrail\` and \`Tier3Error.contextWindowExceeded\`; log, then finish or return an empty stream so callers don’t see these errors.

## Comment 2: Tier3 classify rethrows context-window/session failures instead of degrading to lower tiers

In \`AI/Tier3Engine.swift\` \`classify\`, extend the \`do/catch\` to catch \`Tier3Error.contextWindowExceeded\` and \`Tier3Error.sessionFailed\`; log and return \`nil\` so the caller can fall back to lower tiers instead of propagating the error.

## Recommendations
1. Review the error logs above
2. Check for missing dependencies or configuration issues
3. Manually fix the problematic code
4. Re-run the build agent after fixes
